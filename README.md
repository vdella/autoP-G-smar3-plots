# autoPG-smar3-plots
Plots for the SMAR3 industrial plant. We will be plotting temperature with its own SP and electrical current, but also 
the level of a conical tank with its control valve and SP.

To run the project, you will need to install `Pipenv` and
ask it to install the project libraries. Run the following commands:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv run python tank2_level.py
```
